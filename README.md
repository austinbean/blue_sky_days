# Blue Sky Days in Seattle 2025

*Research Question*: Seattle is cloudy/rainy, but how often do we **see blue sky**?

## Rules

1. I have to see *unobstructed* blue sky.  (**Not** “the *whole* sky is blue” but instead “there is a *piece* of the sky which is clearly blue.”)
    1. *Frequent case which counts*: there is a hole in the cloud cover so there’s a blue section of sky (potentially a small one).
    2. *Corner case which counts*: if it’s early in the morning and the sun hasn’t fully risen yet, that’s ok if part of the sky is otherwise not cloudy but not yet blue.  (Similarly for the evening.)
    3. *Doesn’t count*: the cloud cover is thin but the sky is blu-ish through the cloud cover.  
2. I have to take a picture of it.  (I missed one day: July 3, 2025 - the sky was blue but I didn’t take a picture!  Everyone knows the sky is blue in July!  I count it.)

## Summary By Month

“Total Available Days” may be lower than total days in the month if we were out of town.  Rest assured we don’t choose our vacations to avoid cloudy days.   **[Table is current through 12/31/2025.]**

There was one day at the end of the month where I saw blue sky but didn’t take a picture.  (That doesn’t count b/c it’s January.). There was another day where I took a picture but in retrospect I can’t see blue sky in the picture, so I don’t count it.

## February

**Summary**: 19/20 days.  (We were on vacation for 8 days.)
